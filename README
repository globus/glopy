USAGE

Library wrapping Globus Toolkit. This is intentionally written by hand and not
with SWIG, to make it easy to develop and audit the specific functionality
required by GO.

Currently only supports loading and verifying certificate chains and
credentials, by wrapping globus_gsi_credential. For example:

    import glopy

    c = glopy.Credential()
    c.load_cert_file("/tmp/x509up_u1000")
    print "identity =", c.get_identity()
    print "subject =", c.get_subject()
    print "goodtill =", c.get_goodtill()
    try:
        c.verify_chain()
    except glopy.error as e:
        print "Verify Failed:", str(e)
    else:
        print "Verify OK"

It works even when no private key is present (a certificate chain), and
it understands proxy certificates.

A single credential object can be re-used to load and verify many certificates
and proxies, from files and from strings, within a single thread. However it is
NOT THREAD SAFE, so each thread should have it's own object.


BUILDING

Globus Toolkit 5.0 or 5.2 (5.1.X) is required.

The build script uses vanilla distutils. To build and install, run this
(probably as root):

$ export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr/local/globus GLOBUS_FLAVOR=gcc64dbg
$ python setup.py install

For GT 5.2, set your environment like this:

GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr
GLOBUS_FLAVOR=

If using the debian packages for 5.2, install:
  libglobus-gss-assist-dev
  libglobus-gsi-credential-dev

this list may not be complete - try installing this as well if that fails:
  globus-gsi-cert-utils-progs
  globus-proxy-util


For GT 5.0, set GLOBUS_LOCATION and GLOBUS_FLAVOR to the values used when
you installed globus toolkit.

Note: There are currently lots of warnings from gt header files. It would
be nice to fix these, I may be including a header twice.
